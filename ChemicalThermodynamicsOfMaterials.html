            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p class="info-text">
                A comprehensive introduction, examining both macroscopic and microscopic aspects of the
                subject, the book applies the theory of thermodynamics to a broad range of materials; from metals,
                ceramics and other inorganic materials to geological materials.<br/><br/>

                Focusing on materials rather than the underlying mathematical concepts of the subject, this book will be
                ideal for the non-specialist requiring an introduction to the energetics and stability of materials.
                Macroscopic thermodynamic properties are linked to the underlying miscroscopic nature of the materials
                and trends in important properties are discussed.<br/><br/>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A unique approach covering both macroscopic and microscopic aspects of the subject</li>
                <li>Authors have worldwide reputations in this area</li>
                <li>Fills a gap in the market by featuring a wide range of real up-to-date examples and covering a large amount of materials</li>
            </ul>
