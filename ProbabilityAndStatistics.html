            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p class="info-text">This comprehensive introduction to probability and statistics will give you the solid
                grounding you need no matter what your engineering specialty. Through the use of lively and realistic
                examples, the author helps you go beyond simply learning about statistics--you'll also learn how to put
                the statistical methods to use. In addition, rather than focusing on rigorous mathematical development
                and potentially overwhelming derivations, Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences
                emphasizes concepts, models, methodology, and applications that facilitate your understanding. </p>

            <h3>About the authors</h3>
            <p class="info-text">
                Jay Devore is Professor Emeritus of Statistics at California Polytechnic State University. He earned his
                undergraduate degree in Engineering Science from the University of California at Berkeley, spent a year
                at the University of Sheffield in England, and finished his Ph.D. in statistics at Stanford University.
                Jay previously taught at the University of Florida and at Oberlin College and has had visiting
                appointments at Stanford, Harvard, the University of Washington, New York University, and Columbia
                University. From 1998 to 2006, he served as Chair of the Cal Poly Statistics Department. In addition to
                this book, Jay has written several other widely used statistics texts for engineers and scientists and a
                book in applied mathematical statistics. He recently coauthored a text in probability and stochastic
                processes. He is the recipient of a distinguished teaching award from Cal Poly, is a Fellow of the
                American Statistical Association, and has served several terms as an Associate Editor of the "Journal of
                the American Statistical Association." In his spare time, he enjoys reading, cooking and eating good
                food, tennis, and travel to faraway places. He is especially proud of his wife, Carol, a retired
                elementary school teacher, his daughter Allison, who has held several high-level positions in nonprofit
                organizations in Boston and New York City, and his daughter Teresa, a high school teacher in Brooklyn.
