            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p class="info-text">
                For senior or graduate-level students taking a first course in Control Theory (in departments of
                Mechanical, Electrical, Aerospace, and Chemical Engineering).<br/><br/>


                A comprehensive, senior-level textbook for control engineering.<br/><br/>


                Ogata’s Modern Control Engineering, 5/e , offers the comprehensive coverage of continuous-time control
                systems that all senior students must have, including frequency response approach, root-locus approach,
                and state-space approach to analysis and design of control systems. The text provides a gradual
                development of control theory, shows how to solve all computational problems with MATLAB, and avoids
                highly mathematical arguments. A wealth of examples and worked problems are featured throughout the
                text.<br/><br/>


                The new edition includes improved coverage of Root-Locus Analysis (Chapter 6) and Frequency-Response
                Analysis (Chapter 8). The author has also updated and revised many of the worked examples and
                end-of-chapter problems. This text is ideal for control systems engineers.<br/>
