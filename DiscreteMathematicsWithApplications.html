            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p class="info-text">
                Susanna Epp's DISCRETE MATHEMATICS WITH APPLICATIONS, FOURTH EDITION provides a clear introduction to
                discrete mathematics. Renowned for her lucid, accessible prose, Epp explains complex, abstract concepts
                with clarity and precision. This book presents not only the major themes of discrete mathematics, but
                also the reasoning that underlies mathematical thought. Students develop the ability to think abstractly
                as they study the ideas of logic and proof. While learning about such concepts as logic circuits and
                computer addition, algorithm analysis, recursive thinking, computability, automata, cryptography, and
                combinatorics, students discover that the ideas of discrete mathematics underlie and are essential to
                the science and technology of the computer age. Overall, Epp's emphasis on reasoning provides students
                with a strong foundation for computer science and upper-level mathematics courses.
